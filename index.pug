      div(data-aos='fade-left')
        p First released by #[strong Appleâ„¢] in December 2016, #[strong AirPods] took the world by storm with its #[strong sleek, wireless form]. At a hefty price tag of #[strong ~$150], #[strong AirPods] quickly became a status symbol for #[strong wealth and class].
        p But the #[strong AirPods' clean, white exterior] hides its #[strong true, insidious nature]. Frequent users of the headphones have reported experiencing #[strong delusions of grandeur], #[strong declining social skills], and #[strong fear of losing their AirPods case]. A subset of these #[strong AirPods] users exhibit #[strong abnormally extreme] symptoms, leading many to dub them the #[strong Pod Gang].
        p #[strong(style='color: #e11') AirPod Addiction] follows the tragic story of a Pod Gang member whose #[strong obsession with AirPods] and #[strong inability to socialize with others] eventually leave him #[strong powerless] and #[strong unable to handle reality].
